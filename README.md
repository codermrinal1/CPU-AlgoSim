# CPU-AlgoSim
Developed a CPU Scheduling Simulator in C++ implementing FCFS, SJF (Non-Preemptive), Priority (Non-Preemptive), and Round Robin algorithms. Used arrays and modular functions to compute waiting time and turnaround time for multiple processes. Enabled performance comparison through average metrics calculation and structured output display.
